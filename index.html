					<h3><b> Biography </b></h3>
						<p> Thank you for coming to our web page. We are so happy that you are interested in what we do and how our business is run. I want to welcome you to our very own claw machine only store and hope we get to see you there.

We are family owned and only have exciting passions in our hearts. Your energy and smiles are what gives us the motivation to give you the best prizes.

						<h3><b> What is a Claw Machine?</b></h3>
						<p> If this is your first time learning about claw machines, you don't have to worry because there are many people who don't know as well. Claw Machine's come in different varieties and style. The standard one that we use in our store is called the "Three prong" claw machine, otherwise known as a skill crane or claw crane. There are many claw machines out there that are different and are much simplier than this one (see picture to left). We hope to incorporate more machines like 2 prong UFO Catchers and other Japanese style claw machines. If you have ideas for what kind of claw machines you would like to see feature in our store, please email us!

						<h3><b>Prizes</b></h3>
							<p>Of course, we can't forget the prizes! Our prizes vary from small to big and depending on the machine. You would have to come in and see for yourself on what kind of prizes we have, that's <b>IF</b> you don't think you can handle it. All I can say is that the prizes are well-worth your time and are not disappointing. We are determine to give you all the best prizes and hopefully get more popularity and trending prizes. Please see the prize tab for more pictures. Just like the Claw machine request, if you think we should carry prizes of your liking, please email us!</p>

						<h2>Tips and Guides</h2>
							<p> In order to be good or great at clawing your prize, there are some things you must keep in mind: <br>
							1) Maintain a strong mindset in winning your prize<br>
							2) Watch the middle point of the claw and position that to the center of the prize.<br>
							3) Don't expect to get it on the first try, it will take a couple times before the claw is warmed up. </p>
